## üè† Friends Hostel Management System

The Friends Hostel Management System is a **Java Swing desktop application** designed to make hostel administration tasks easier through a user-friendly graphical interface. This project provides a complete workflow for managing the hostel, including secure login, student and staff record management, and credit information for the developers.

***

### Overview

The application starts with a **Welcome Screen**, guiding the user to either proceed, view contributions, or exit. From there, users log in using predefined credentials.  
Once logged in, they reach a **Home Page** where they can navigate to:

- **Student Management** ‚Äì Full CRUD operations (add, update, delete, view) on student info including names, phone number, room assigned, university name, and payment details. Includes a structured table display and form input fields.
- **Staff (Stuff) Management** ‚Äì Similar CRUD operations for staff, capturing data such as names, contact information, national ID, work role, and salary.
- **Contribution Page** ‚Äì Lists the developers with their names and student IDs.
- **Exit Application** ‚Äì Close the app at any point.

The project uses **Java Swing** for GUI components (buttons, labels, text fields, tables) and **AWT** for graphics and event handling. The interface is designed to be both functional and visually pleasant, with background images, icons, and styled fonts.
